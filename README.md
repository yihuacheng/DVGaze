Dual cameras have been applied in many devices recently. In this paper, we explore a new direction for gaze estimation. We propose a dual-view gaze estimation network (DV-Gaze) including dual-view interactive convolution block and dual-view transformers. This work is accepted by ICCV 2023.

We will release method and data-processing codes as soon as possible.
